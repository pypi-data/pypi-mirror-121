# Kalash

Kalash is a simple test runner built for large-scale test automation which relies on a simple YAML-based configuration or Python file configuration.

## Why Kalash

Kalash decouples the work of a QA Engineer from the need to manage automation server jobs. It makes running tests in local and automated contexts easy and pleasurable with comprehensible YAML or Python file configuration approach.
