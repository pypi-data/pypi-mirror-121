=================================================
RN-Simplex: Regular N-dimensional Simplex Builder
=================================================

Brief Description
=================

Regular n-dimensional simplex builder with optional translation and scaling.



Installation
============

The ``RN-Simplex`` project is published on the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org>`_ at: `https://pypi.org/project/rn-simplex <https://pypi.org/project/rn-simplex>`_. It requires version 3.8, or newer, of the interpreter. It should be installable from Python distribution platforms or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Otherwise, it can be installed from a command-line console:

- For all users, after acquiring administrative rights:
    - First installation: ``pip install rn-simplex``
    - Installation update: ``pip install --upgrade rn-simplex``
- For the current user (no administrative rights required):
    - First installation: ``pip install --user rn-simplex``
    - Installation update: ``pip install --user --upgrade rn-simplex``



Documentation
=============

The project provides a package ``rn_simplex`` with 2 modules: the main one, ``simplex``, and a basic test module, ``test_simplex``. The module ``simplex`` defines 2 functions: ``Simplex``, to build a regular n-dimensional simplex, and ``IsARegularSimplex``, to check whether a set of vertices defines a regular simplex.

The ``Simplex`` function takes a dimension as a mandatory argument and the following optional, keyword-only arguments:

- centered: A boolean to request the centering of the simplex. False by default.
- around: A `Numpy array <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html>`_ to request the translation and scaling of the simplex so that its vertices lie on the smallest bounding ball of ``around``, or ``None``. The array shape must be ``(n_points, dimension_of_simplex)``. None by default.
- with_a_margin: A float to request an additive margin when passing ``around``, or None. None by default.
- with_m_margin: A float to request a multiplicative margin when passing ``around``, or None. None by default.

The project is developed with `PyCharm Community <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm>`_.

The development relies on several open-source packages (see ``install_requires`` in ``setup.py``).

The code is formatted by `Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_, *The Uncompromising Code Formatter*.

The imports are ordered by `isort <https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort>`_... *your imports, so you don't have to*.
