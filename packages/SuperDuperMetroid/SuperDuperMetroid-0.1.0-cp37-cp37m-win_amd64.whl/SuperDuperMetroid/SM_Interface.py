# Super Metroid Interface
# By Samuel D. Roy
#
# This script is used for interfacing with SNI for the Super Metroid randomizer.
# This script also exposes some functionality which trackers and other programs can use.
#
# Data about the SM game which can be probed:
# -Current game state (ex. title screen, in game, paused, etc.)
# -Current game region (ex. Crateria, Maridia, Ceres, etc.)
# -Current player map coordinates
# -Current game room
# -Map progress (e.g. which map squares have been visited)
# -Map stations visited
# -Current inventory
# -Item locations obtained
# -Console type (Emulator, SD2SNES, SNES Classic)

# In theory, a player might be able to break this if they somehow switched states in between the steps of a key operation.
# If a player, for example, unloaded their game after we checked to see that their game was loaded but before we check their status,
# That could possibly cause us to get a garbage value.
# There's not really anything we can do about that, since there's no way to lock this data (to my knowledge).
# This is incredibly unlikely, however, as the speed of this program and its interface
# Is significantly faster than the framerate of an SNES (and obviously blows the speed of a human's actions out of the water).
# If interfacing is slower with physical devices there may be a need for further investigation.

# TODO: Implement data sharing with this.
# Some data from the launcher needs to be sent to the interface for it to function fully.
# This includes:
#   -Message Box Address Dict
#   -Item Routine Address Dict
#   -List of non-vanilla items in game
