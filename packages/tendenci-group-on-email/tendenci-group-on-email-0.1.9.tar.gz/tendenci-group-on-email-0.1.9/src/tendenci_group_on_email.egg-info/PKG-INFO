Description: =======================
        Tendenci Group on Email

        To install, add ``group_on_email`` to Django's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
        Thereafter, members are added to and removed from the ".edu" group when their
        profile is updated. The group can be entirely regenerated with the
        ``group_on_email`` management command.
