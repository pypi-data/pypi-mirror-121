Description: # The PyStar 
        ![PyStar Logo](./assets/logo.png)
        
        PyStar is a user-friendly application for anyone who would like to learn simulations. It shows relevant quantities for each of modeling system. 
        Explore and enjoy.
        
        # Requirements
        This application uses [ESPResSo package](https://espressomd.org/) as a backend. Thus, it is essential to get compiled your package. The rest can be installed via 
        `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
        
        # Introduction
        PyStar is an application to learn about simulations. The application can provide you variety of use cases: starting from demonstration concents of model/methods to new students and ending by comprehensive university course about modeling.
        
        The application is written in user-friendly way. You can pull slicers, toggle checkboxes drag and drop particles to tune your own simulation setup.
        
        
        # QuickStart
        ```python
        import espressomd
        from simlearn import PyStar
        PyStar.run()
        ```
        
        # Future Content of the Software
        * Introduce new ensembles: NpT, RE
        * Introduce new systems: chains, gels, combs..
        * ...
        
        # The team
        PyStar is currently maintained by [Alexander D. Kazakov](https://github.com/AlexanderDKazakov/) with contributions coming from talented individuals in various forms and means. A non-exhaustive but growing list needs to mention: Tabea G. Langen, Pascal Hebbeker, Peter Kosovan, Filip Uhlík, Lucie Nová.
