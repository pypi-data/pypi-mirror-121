# alamopy

This is an interface for using ALAMO through a Python pip package.

<h2> Preparation : </h2>

<h4> for MacOS users: </h4>

Download the ALAMO application from minlp.com, and unzip the package.

<h4>  for Windows users: </h4>

Download the ALAMO application from minlp.com, and install with the provided installer.

<h2> Data to run ALAMO:</h2>

Add the directory of the folder you have installed the pip package with your Python file to your PATH variable.

Get your ALAMO license from minlp.com and place it inside the same folder as the Python file.

Before running ALAMO, you should decide if you will provide your own data. If so, make sure your data are all in numpy arrays.
Otherwise, select the appropriate simulator to run ALAMO.

pip install alamopy\
python\
import numpy as np

## Example


Test 1 to see if we can generate model for z = x\*\*2
Most notably tests if the given example 1 works from ALAMO UI.

from alamopy import almain as alamo\
import numpy as np

xdata = np.random.rand(11, 1)\
xdata[:, 0] = [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5]

zdata = xdata[:, 0]\*\*2

opts = alamo.doalamo(xdata, zdata, linfcns = 1, logfcns = 1, sinfcns = 1, cosfns = 1, constant = 1, expfcns = 1, monomialpower = [2,3], keep_alm_file=True, keep_lst_file=True)

<h2> Outputs from ALAMO </h2>

You would get the result dictionary with a best-fitted function and other variables when calling ALAMO using this python interface.
