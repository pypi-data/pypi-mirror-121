# Pyramid Pooling implemented in PyTorch
This Module implements Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and Temporal Pyramid Pooling (TPP) as described in different papers.

**NOTE** This repo has been forked from <a href="https://github.com/revidee/pytorch-pyramid-pooling">Revidee's original</a> (which seems to no longer be under maintenance) to publish on Pypi. I (Eric Musa) take no credit for writing the Pyramid Pooling code, but could not find any information on Revidee to provide proper credit.

# The purpose of this fork is to continue maintenance of this package and post on Pypi

### Principle
Given an 2D input Tensor, Temporal Pyramid Pooling divides the input in **x** _stripes_ which **extend through the height** of the image and **width of roughly (input_width / x)**. These stripes are then each pooled with max- or avg-pooling to calculate the output.

### Principle
Given an 2D input Tensor, Spatial Pyramid Pooling divides the input in **xÂ²** _rectangles_ with **height of roughly (input_height / x)** and **width of roughly (input_width / x)**. These rectangles are then each pooled with max- or avg-pooling to calculate the output.
