## Set up and requierements needed to run the code
This code was developed under Python 3, and needs the following libraries. .

- `obspy>=1.1`
- `python_speech_features`
- `sympy`


Create and activate your working environment (in a terminal session):  

`conda create -n aaa_features python=3.9`  
`conda activate aaa_features`

# Clone the repository and install 

`git clone https://github.com/awacero/aaa_features.git` 

`cd aaa_features` 

`pip install .` 


# Install the package aaa_features from PYPI:

`pip install aaa_features`  


## Configuration files 
	 	
- the feature setting file, contained in `config_sample/features*.json` 

## MSEED data sample
- the folder data_sample contains a MSEED file from the station EC RETU SHZ 2012-06-28

## Run the code to get the features

`python call_aaa_features.py`
