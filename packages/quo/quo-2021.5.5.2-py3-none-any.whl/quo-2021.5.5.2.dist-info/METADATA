`Forever Scalable`

**Quo** is a Python based toolkit for writing Command-Line Interface(CLI) applications.
Quo is making headway towards composing speedy and orderly CLI applications while forestalling any disappointments brought about by the failure to execute a CLI API.
Simple to code, easy to learn, and does not come with needless baggage. 

Quo requires Python `3.6.1` or later. 


## Features
- Support for ANSI and RGB color models
- Support for tabular presentation of data
- Interactive progressbars
- Code completions
- Nesting of commands
- Automatic help page generation
- Highlighting
- Lightweight

## Getting Started
### Installation
You can install quo via the Python Package Index (PyPI)

```
pip install -U quo
```


### Quo print
**Example 1**
```python
   from quo import echo
   echo(f"Hello, World!", fg="red", italic=True, bold=True))
```
![Hello World](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/pics/print.png)

**Example 2**
```python
   from quo import echo
   echo(f"Quo is ", nl=False)
   echo(f"scalable", bg="red", fg="black") 
```
![Scalable](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/pics/scalable.png)

Unlike the builtin print function, ``echo`` function has improved support for handling Unicode and binary data.
It also supports handling of ANSI color sequences.

### Quo prompt
```python
   from quo import prompt
   prompt("What is your name?")
```
![prompt](https://github.com/secretum-inc/quo/raw/master/pics/prompt.png)

### Quo tabular
```python
   from quo import echo
   from quo.tabulate import tabular

   echo(tabular([["Name","Gender", "Age"],["Alice","F",24],["Bob","M",19]]))
```
