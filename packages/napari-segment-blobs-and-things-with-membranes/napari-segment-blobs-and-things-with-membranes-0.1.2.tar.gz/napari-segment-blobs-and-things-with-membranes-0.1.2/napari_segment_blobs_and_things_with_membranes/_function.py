    The two sigma parameters allow tuning the segmentation result. The first sigma controls how close detected cells
    can be (spot_sigma) and the second controls how precise segmented objects are outlined (outline_sigma). Under the
    hood, this filter applies two Gaussian blurs, spot detection, Otsu-thresholding and Voronoi-labeling. The
    thresholded binary image is flooded using the Voronoi approach starting from the found local maxima. Noise-removal
    sigma for spot detection and thresholding can be configured separately.
