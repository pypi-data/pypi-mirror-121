CHANGES
=======

0.2.1
-----

* Install apache-airflow-providers-google==5.1.0 with --no-deps so that pip doesn't spend forever trying to resolve dependencies for it, as we only use it for Google Cloud Secret Manager Backend. Add google-cloud-secret-manager as dependency in requirements.txt. (#506)
