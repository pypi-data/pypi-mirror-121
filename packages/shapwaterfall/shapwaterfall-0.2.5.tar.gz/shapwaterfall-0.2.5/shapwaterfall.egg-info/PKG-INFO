**Introduction**

Many times when VMware Data Science Teams present their Machine Learning models' propensity to buy scores (estimated probabilities) to stakeholders, stakeholders ask why a customer's propensity to buy is higher than the other customer. The stakeholder's question was our primary motivation. 

We were further concerned with recent algorithm transparency language in the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Although the 'right to explanation' is not necessarily clear, our desire is to act in good faith by providing local explainability and interpretability between two references, observations, clients, and customers.

This graph solution provides a local classification model interpretability between two observations, which internally we call customers. It uses each customer's estimated probability and fills the gap between the two probabilities with SHAP values that are ordered from higher to lower importance. We prefer SHAP over others (for example, LIME) because of its concrete theory and ability to fairly distribute effects.

Updated, this package works for all classification models. We added the Kernel Explainer.

The package requires a classifier, training data, validation/test/scoring data, the two observations of interest (row index), and the desired number of important features. The package produces a Waterfall Chart. 

**Command**

shapwaterfall(*clf, X_tng, X_val, index1, index2, num_features*)

**Required**

- *clf*: a tree based classifier that is fitted to X_tng, training data.
- *X_tng*: the training Data Frame used to fit the model.
- *X_val*: the validation, test, or scoring Data Frame under observation. Note that the data frame must contain an extra column who's label is 'Reference'.
- *index1 and index2*: the first and second index numbers.
- *num_features*: the number of important features that describe the local interpretability between to the two observations.

**Dependent Packages**

The shapwaterfall package requires the following python packages:

	import pandas as pd
	import numpy as np
	import shap
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	import waterfall_chart

**Examples**

**Random Forest on WI Breast Cancer Data**

	# Scikit-Learn WI Breast Cancer Data Example
	# packages
	import pandas as pd
	import numpy as np
	from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
	from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
	from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
	from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
	import shap
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	import waterfall_chart
	from shapwaterfall import shapwaterfall

	# models
	rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=1666, max_features="auto", min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=2, max_depth=20, bootstrap=True, n_jobs=1)

	# load and organize Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data
	data = load_breast_cancer()
	label_names = data['target_names']
	labels = data['target']
	feature_names = data['feature_names']
	features = data['data']

	# data splits
	X_tng, X_val, y_tng, y_val = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

	print(X_tng.shape) # (381, 30)
	print(X_val.shape) # (188, 30)

	X_tng = pd.DataFrame(X_tng)
	X_tng.columns = feature_names
	X_val = pd.DataFrame(X_val)
	X_val.columns = feature_names

	# fit classifiers and measure AUC
	clf = rf_clf.fit(X_tng, y_tng)
	pred_rf = clf.predict_proba(X_val)
	score_rf = roc_auc_score(y_val,pred_rf[:,1])
	print(score_rf, 'Random Forest AUC')

	# 0.9951893425434809 Random Forest AUC

	# Use Case 1
	shapwaterfall(clf, X_tng, X_val, 5, 100, 5)
	shapwaterfall(clf, X_tng, X_val, 100, 5, 7)

	# Use Case 2
	shapwaterfall(clf, X_tng, X_val, 36, 94, 5)
	shapwaterfall(clf, X_tng, X_val, 94, 36, 7)
