# tiedpyranges
Extends the pyranges module with operations on joined genomic intervals (e.g. exons of same transcript)

Install with:

``pip install tiedpyranges``

or

``conda install -c mmariotti tiedpyranges``


Then use within python:

``>>> from tiedpyranges import pyranges``

The ``pyranges`` module imported will have all functions from the original pyranges (see https://pyranges.readthedocs.io/).

Additionally, you have available tiedpyranges-specific functions documented in the documentation.tar file included in github.
