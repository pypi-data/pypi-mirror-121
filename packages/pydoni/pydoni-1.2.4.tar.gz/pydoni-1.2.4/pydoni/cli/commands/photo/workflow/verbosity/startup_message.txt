Welcome to the Photo ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) Data
Workflow! This pipeline refreshes the local Photo database
in Postgres with source mediafile metadata.

This pipeline is entirely {click.style('non-destructive', bold=True)}, meaning
none of the original source file metadata is not mutated in any way.

->->->->->->->->->->->->-> {click.style('Verbosity', bold=True)} <-<-<-<-<-<-<-<-<-<-<-<-<-

Colorized tags are used in the verbose output of this
workflow to indicate where a particular option has affected
the execution of the workflow:

{tab}{click.style('<full-refresh>', fg='red')}
{tab}Indicates that all rows from a staged table have been
{tab}deleted, but the table structure has remained intact.

{tab}{click.style('<dry-run>', fg='magenta')}
{tab}Indicates that SQL was not actually executed against the
{tab}target Postgres DB, but rather that it {click.style('would have', bold=True)}
{tab}been executed, had this flag not been set to {click.style('True', bg='white')}.

{tab}{click.style('<step-name>', fg='blue')}
{tab}Indicates a particular workflow subprocess is responsible
{tab}for a line of logged output.

Let's go!
