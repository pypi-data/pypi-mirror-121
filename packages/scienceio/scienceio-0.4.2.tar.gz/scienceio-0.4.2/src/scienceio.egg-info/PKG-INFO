# ScienceIO

The official ScienceIO Python SDK for the BioNLP API.

This package is available via [Pypi:scienceIO](https://pypi.org/project/scienceio/). View full documentation at [ScienceIO Docs](https://docs.science.io/docs).


## Usage and examples

1. Install ScienceIO

   ```python
   pip install scienceio
   ```

3. Register:

   ```python
   from scienceio import ScienceIO
   ScienceIO.register(
       first_name="Demo name",
       last_name="Demo lastname",
       email="your@email.com"
   )
   ```

   You will be sent an email asking you to verify your account. As part of the process you will be asked to create a password.


2. Create a directory `.scio` in your home directory (Mac users, your home directory is `/Users/{username}`. Linux users, your home directory is `/home/{username}`. Windows users, your home directory is `C:\\Users\{username})` Inside this directory, create a text file called `config` containing your credentials:

   ```
   [SETTINGS]
   email=your@email.com
   ```

4. Query the BioNLP API:

   ```python
   scio = ScienceIO()
   query_text = (
     'The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of '
     'cases among children 1â€“4. Age disparities in observed cases could be '
     'explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower '
     'propensity to show clinical symptoms or both.'
   )

   results = scio.annotate(query_text)
   print(results)
   ```
