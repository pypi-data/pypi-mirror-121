# sheet2linkml
A python package for converting the CRDC-H data model, which is currently stored in a 
[Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oWS7cao-fgz2MKWtyr8h2dEL9unX__0bJrWKv6mQmM4/). The command line utility built into the package can be used 
to generate a [LinkML](https://github.com/linkml/linkml) representation of the CRDC-H data model.
