Description: PhotoSex
        
        A simple package to perform photometry on FITS images based on Sextractor+PSFEX, including aperture photometry and PSF photometry.
        This package calls external Sextractor and PSFEX applications, thus please install Sextractor+PSFEX firstly and make sure that you can call them directly in terminal.
        This package also includes checking routines which means it can produce some checking images and figures.
        You just need to offer one FITS image and choose a working directory, then the package can perform photometry on the image and produce the temporary and final results in the working directory. Please note that you must offer a sextractor directory which includes all configuration files for Sextractor and PSFEX.
