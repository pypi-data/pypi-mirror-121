        Pythonic API for linux's gpiochip chardev ABI v2.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Manage multile GPIO lines at the same time, with bit operation affecting the
          entire line group at the same time (`|=`, `&=`, `^=`).
        - Get file event notification of timestamped line events (rising edge, falling
          edge).
        - Get file event notifications (select, poll, epoll...) of gpiochip-level and
          line-level events.
        - Control line parameters (pull-up, pull-down, active-low, debouncing, ...).
        - Pure python module: no compilation needed, not limited to CPython.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        - Linux >=5.10.0 for GPIO chardev ABI v2
        - python stdlib >=3.7.10 (not tested with earlier versions, they may work)
        
        Examples
        --------
        
        Warning: this example is **not** meant to be executed as-is. Depending on what
        is connected to the GPIO lines used here (which is entirely board-dependent),
        this could cause all sort of problems, including permanent hardware damage.
        
        This is only to be taken as a quick overview of this module's API.

            with GPIOChip('/dev/gpiochip0', 'w+b') as gpiochip:
                # Get information about the gpio chip itself
                gpiochip.getInfo()
                # Get information about line 20
                gpiochip.getLineInfo(20)
                with gpiochip.openLines(
                    line_list=[20, 21, 26],

                    },
                ) as gpio_lines:
                    # Read lines state
                    value = gpio_lines.lines
                    # Change lines state
                    gpio_lines.lines = 0b11
                    # Invert line 20
                    gpio_lines ^= 1 # 1 << 0
                    # Set line 21
                    gpio_lines |= 2 # 1 << 1
                    # Clear line 21
                    gpio_lines &= 2 # 1 << 1
                    # Read event
                    lines.getEvent()
