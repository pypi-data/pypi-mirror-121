    Creates a new MySQL database connection.

    But first, make sure your database is running and you can reach it
    from via your command line.

    Args:
        dbname (str):
            The name of the database to which you want to connect.

        user (str):
            User name with which to log into the MySQL database.

        password (str):
            Password with which to log into the MySQL database.

        host (str):
            Host of the MySQL database.

        port (int, optional):
            Port of the MySQL database.

            The default port for MySQL is 3306.

            If you do not know which port to use, type

            .. code-block:: sql

                SELECT @@port;

            into your mysql client.

        unix_socket (str, optional):
            The UNIX socket used to connect to the MySQL database.

            If you do not know which UNIX socket to use, type

            .. code-block:: sql

                SELECT @@socket;

            into your mysql client.

        time_formats (List[str], optional):
            The list of formats tried when parsing time stamps.

            The formats are allowed to contain the following
            special characters:

            * %w - abbreviated weekday (Mon, Tue, ...)
            * %W - full weekday (Monday, Tuesday, ...)
            * %b - abbreviated month (Jan, Feb, ...)
            * %B - full month (January, February, ...)
            * %d - zero-padded day of month (01 .. 31)
            * %e - day of month (1 .. 31)
            * %f - space-padded day of month ( 1 .. 31)
            * %m - zero-padded month (01 .. 12)
            * %n - month (1 .. 12)
            * %o - space-padded month ( 1 .. 12)
            * %y - year without century (70)
            * %Y - year with century (1970)
            * %H - hour (00 .. 23)
            * %h - hour (00 .. 12)
            * %a - am/pm
            * %A - AM/PM
            * %M - minute (00 .. 59)
            * %S - second (00 .. 59)
            * %s - seconds and microseconds (equivalent to %S.%F)
            * %i - millisecond (000 .. 999)
            * %c - centisecond (0 .. 9)
            * %F - fractional seconds/microseconds (000000 - 999999)
            * %z - time zone differential in ISO 8601 format (Z or +NN.NN)
            * %Z - time zone differential in RFC format (GMT or +NNNN)
            * %% - percent sign

        conn_id (str, optional):
            The name to be used to reference the connection.
            If you do not pass anything, this will create a new default connection.

    Note:
        By selecting an existing table of your database in
        :func:`~getml.DataFrame.from_db` function, you can create
        a new :class:`~getml.DataFrame` containing all its data.
        Alternatively you can use the
        :meth:`~.getml.DataFrame.read_db` and
        :meth:`~.getml.DataFrame.read_query` methods to replace
        the content of the current :class:`~getml.DataFrame`
        instance or append further rows based on either a table or a
        specific query.

        You can also write your results back into the MySQL
        database. By passing the name for the destination table to
        :meth:`getml.Pipeline.transform`, the features
        generated from your raw data will be written back. Passing
        them into :meth:`getml.Pipeline.predict`, instead,
        makes predictions of the target variables to new, unseen data
        and stores the result into the corresponding table.
