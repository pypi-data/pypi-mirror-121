# atc-dataplatform
A common set of python libraries for DataBricks

## Important Notes

This package can not be run or tested without access to pyspark.
However, installing pyspark as part of our installer gave issues when
other versions of pyspark were needed. Hence we took out the dependency
from our installer.
