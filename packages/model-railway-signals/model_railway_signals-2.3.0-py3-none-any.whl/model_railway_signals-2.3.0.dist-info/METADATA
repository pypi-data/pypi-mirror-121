# model-railway-signalling
A model railway signalling library written in Python for the Raspberry Pi with a DCC control of Signals and Points and train 
detection via the GPIO ports on the Pi. For details of the "Public" API - scroll down the page

A simple interface to the Pi-SPROG-3 DCC Command station enables DCC control of the signals and points out on the layout. 
The GPIO interface allows external train detectors such as the BlockSignalling BOD2-NS to be connected in via opto-isolators.

All of the functions for creating and managing 'signals', 'points', 'sections' and 'sensors' have been developed as a Python Package 
to promote re-use across other layouts. This includes functions to support the interlocking of signals and points to enable 
fully prototypical signalling schemes to be developed. The signals and points opjects can be easily mapped to one or more DCC 
addresses in a manner that should be compatible with the majority of DCC signal/points decoders currently on the market. 
Track sensors can also be easily integrated (via the Raspberry Pi's GPIO interface) to enable full automatic control.

Most types of colour light signals, semaphore signals, ground position light signals and ground disc signals are supported.

Note that I have tried to make the package platform independent so you can use it to develop your own layout signalling schemes 
without a Raspberry Pi or the associated Pi-SPROG-3 DCC Command station (track sensors can be manually 'triggered' via the
layout schematic to ensure your code is doing what its supposed to do). Full logging is provided to help you develop/debug 
your own schemes - just set the log level to INFO to see what the package is doing 'under the hood'. And when you do enable
the DCC control aspects, a log level of DEBUG will show you the commands being sent out to the Pi-SPROG-3

Comments and suggestions welcome - but please be kind - the last time I coded anything it was in Ada96 ;)

## Using the package

To use the "public" functions for developing your own layout signalling system:
<code> from model_railway_signals import * </code>

Some examples are included in the repository: https://github.com/johnrm174/model-railway-signalling:

<pre>
'test_simple_example.py' - a simple example of how to use the "signals" and "points" modules to create a
           basic track schematic with interlocked signals/points and semi-automation of signals using 
           external track sensors to provide "signal passed" events as the train progresses across the 
           schematic. Also includes DCC Mapping examples (for both signals and points).

'test_semaphore_example.py' - effectively the same example as above, but using sempahore signals. 
           Includes DCC Mapping examples for the Semaphore signals (different to colour lights).

'test_approach_control.py' - an example of using "approach control" for automation of junction signals. This 
           is where a signal displays a more restrictive aspect (either red or yellow) when a lower-speed 
           divergent route is set, forcing the approaching train to slow down and be prepared to stop. As 
           the train approaches, the signal is "released", allowing the train to proceed past the signal 
           and onto the divergent route. Examples of "Approach on Red" and "Approach on Yellow" are provided. 
           For "Approach on yellow", the signals behind will show the correct flashing yellow aspects.

'test_semaphore_approach_control' - Similar to the above, but this simulates/automates the series of 
           signals within a block section (e.g. outer home, inner home, starter, advanced starter etc). 
           In this scenario, the distant and home signals should never be cleared for an approaching train 
           if a subsequent home signal (in the same 'Block Section') is set to DANGER. In this case each 
           preceding home signal (and the distant) would remain ON to slow down the train on the approach
           to the first home signal. As the signal is approached, the signal would then be cleared to 
           enable the train to continue (at low speed) towards the next home signal.

'test_harman-signalist_sc1.py'- developed primarily for testing using the Harmann Signallist SC1 decoder. 
           Enables the various modes to be selected (includes programming of CVs) and then tested. I used 
           this decoder as it provided the most flexibility for some of my more complex signal types.
           Note that some of the modes will be similar/identical to other manufacturer's DCC signals.

'test_colour_light_signals.py'- developed primarily for testing, but it does provide an example of every 
           signal type and all the control features currently supported.

'test_semaphore_signals.py'- similar to the above developed primarily for testing, but it does provide  
           an example of every signal type and all the control features currently supported.

trigger_timed_signal - Sets the signal to DANGER and then cycles through the aspects back to PROCEED
                      - If a start delay >0 is specified then a 'sig_passed' callback event is generated
                      - when the signal is changed to DANGER - For each subsequent aspect change (all the
                      - way back to PROCEED) a 'sig_updated' callback event will be generated
  Mandatory Parameters:
      sig_id:int - The ID for the signal

                       is set in "approach control" mode then the signals behind will display the appropriate
                       aspects when updated (based on the signal ahead). for "Release on Red" these would be 
                       the normal aspects. For "Release on Yellow", assuming 4 aspect signals, the signals  
                       behind will display flashing single yellow and flashing double yellow aspects.
  Mandatory Parameters:
      sig_id:int - The ID for the signal
  Optional Parameters:
      release_on_yellow:Bool - True = Yellow Approach aspect, False = Red Approach aspect (default=False)

clear_approach_control - This "releases" the signal to display the normal aspect and should be called when
                           a train is approaching the signal (so the signal clears in front of the driver)
                           Note that signals can also be released when the "release control button" is activated
                           (which is displayed just in front of the signal if specified at signal creation time)
  Mandatory Parameters:

These functions provide the means to map the signals and points on the layout to the series of DCC 
commands needed to control them.

For the main signal aspects, either "Truth Table" or "Event Driven" mappings can be defined
The "Event Driven" mapping uses a single dcc command (address/state) to change the signal to 
the required aspect - as used by the TrainTech DCC signals. The "Truth Table" mapping provides
maximum flexibility for commanding DCC Signals as each "led" can either be controlled individually 
(i.e. Each LED of the signal is controlled via its own individual address) or via a "Truth Table" 
(where the displayed aspect will depend on the binary "code" written to 2 or more DCC addresses)
This has been successfully tested with the Harman Signallist SC1 DCC Decoder in various modes

"Truth Table" or "Event Driven" mappings can alos be defined for the Route indications supported by
the signal (feathers or theatre). If the signal has a subsidary associated with it, this is always
mapped to a single DCC address.

Not all signals/points that exist on the layout need to have a DCC Mapping configured - If no DCC mapping 
has been defined, then no DCC commands will be sent. This provides flexibility for including signals on the 
schematic which are "off scene" or for progressively "working up" the signalling scheme for a layout.

map_dcc_signal - Map a signal to one or more DCC Addresses
   Mandatory Parameters:
      sig_id:int - The ID for the signal to create a DCC mapping for
   Optional Parameters:
      auto_route_inhibit:bool - If the signal inhibits route indications at DANGER (default=False)
      proceed[[add:int,state:bool],] - List of DCC addresses/states (default = no mapping)
      danger [[add:int,state:bool],] - List of DCC addresses/states (default = No mapping)
      caution[[add:int,state:bool],] - List of DCC addresses/states (default = No mapping)
      prelim_caution[[add:int,state:bool],] - List of DCC addresses/states (default = No mapping)
      LH1[[add:int,state:bool],] - List of DCC addresses/states for "LH45" (default = No Mapping)

      RH2[[add:int,state:bool],] - List of DCC addresses/states for "RH90" (default = No Mapping)
      MAIN[[add:int,state:bool],] - List of DCC addresses/states for "MAIN" (default = No Mapping)
      NONE[[add:int,state:bool],] - List of DCC addresses/states to inhibit routes (default = No Mapping)
              Note that you should ALWAYS provide mappings for NONE if you are using feather route indications
              unless the DCC signal automatically inhibits route indications when displaying a DANGER aspect
      THEATRE[["character",[add:int,state:bool],],] - List of possible theatre indicator states (default = No Mapping)
              Each entry comprises the "character" and the associated list of DCC addresses/states
              "#" is a special character - which means inhibit all indications (when signal is at danger)
              Note that you should ALWAYS provide mappings for '#' if you are using a theatre route indicator
              unless the DCC signal itself inhibits route indications when displaying a DANGER aspect
      subsidary:int - Single DCC address for the "position light" indication (default = No Mapping)

    An example DCC mapping for a  Signalist SC1 decoder with a base address of 1 (CV1=5) is included below.
    This assumes the decoder is configured in "8 individual output" Mode (CV38=8). In this example we are using
    outputs A,B,C,D to drive our signal with E & F driving the feather indications. The Signallist SC1 uses 8 
    consecutive addresses in total (which equate to DCC addresses 1 to 8 for this example). The DCC addresses for
    each LED are: RED = 1, Green = 2, YELLOW1 = 3, YELLOW2 = 4, Feather1 = 5, Feather2 = 6.

           map_dcc_signal (sig_id = 2,
                danger = [[1,True],[2,False],[3,False],[4,False]],
                proceed = [[1,False],[2,True],[3,False],[4,False]],
                caution = [[1,False],[2,False],[3,True],[4,False]],
                prelim_caution = [[1,False],[2,False],[3,True],[4,True]],
                LH1 = [[5,True],[6,False]], 
                MAIN = [[6,True],[5,False]], 
                NONE = [[5,False],[6,False]] )

     A second example DCC mapping, but this time with a Feather Route Indication, is shown below. In this case,
     the main signal aspects are configured identically to the first example. The only difference is the THEATRE
     mapping - where a display of "1" is enabled by DCC Address 5 and "2" by DCC Address 6. Note the special "#"
     character mapping - which defines the DCC commands that need to be sent to inhibit the theatre display.

            map_dcc_signal (sig_id = 2,
                danger = [[1,True],[2,False],[3,False],[4,False]],
                proceed = [[1,False],[2,True],[3,False],[4,False]],
                caution = [[1,False],[2,False],[3,True],[4,False]],
                prelim_caution = [[1,False],[2,False],[3,True],[4,True]],
                THEATRE = [ ["#",[[5,False],[6,False]]],
                            ["1",[[6,False],[5,True]]],
                            ["2",[[5,False],[6,True]]]  ] )

              Note that you should ALWAYS provide mappings for '#' if you are using a theatre route indicator
              unless the DCC signal itself inhibits route indications when displaying a DANGER aspect

     Semaphore signal DCC mappings assume that each main/subsidary signal arm is mapped to a seperate DCC address.
     In this example, we are mapping a signal with MAIN and LH signal arms and a subsidary arm for the MAIN route.
     Note that if the semaphore signal had a theatre type route indication, then this would be mapped in exactly
     the same was as for the Colour Light Signal example above)

           map_semaphore_signal (sig_id = 2, 
                        main_signal = 1 , 
                        lh1_signal = 2 , 
                        main_subsidary = 3)

## Pi-Sprog Interface Functions

This provides a basic CBUS interface fpor communicating with the Pi-SPROG3 via the Raspberry Pi UART. It does not provide
a fully-functional interface for all DCC command and control functions - just the minimum set needed to support the driving
of signals and points via a selection of common DCC Accessory decoders. Basic CV Programming is also supported - primarily 
as an aid to testing. For full decoder programming the recommendation is to use JRMI DecoderPro.

                            command station status (from the Pi-SPROG-3)

service_mode_write_cv - programmes a CV in direct bit mode and waits for response
                      (events are only sent if we think the track power is currently switched on)
                      (if acknowledgement isn't received within 5 seconds then the request times out)
   Mandatory Parameters:
      cv:int - The CV (Configuration Variable) to be programmed
      value:int - The value to programme

request_dcc_power_on - sends a request to switch on the track power and waits for acknowledgement
                     (requests are only sent if the Pi Sprog Comms Port has been successfully opened/configured)
       returns True if we have received acknowledgement that Track Power has been turned on
       returns False if acknowledgement isn't received within 5 seconds (i.e. request timeout)

request_dcc_power_off - sends a request to switch off the track power and waits for acknowledgement
                     (requests are only sent if the Pi Sprog Comms Port has been successfully opened/configured)
       returns True if we have received acknowledgement that Track Power has been turned off
       returns False if acknowledgement isn't received within 5 seconds (i.e. request timeout)
