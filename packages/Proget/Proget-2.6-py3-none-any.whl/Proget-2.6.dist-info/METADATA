Which Operating systems are supported?
  
  Only windows is supported

What if the software doesn't support my architecture?
  
  If your architecture is not supported then, the file which contains the links gives a negative response by returning a string. and you will be informed about that.

then, it will look into the softwares listed in [proget.whms.repl.co](https://proget.whms.repl.co)

after that, it will download the file.. and open it once installed.

pass on the version like this:

`proget download (v3.8)`

it will download the version `v3.8` of `python`

### 2. Github

simple.. downloads a github repo

ex: `proget github microsoft/terminal`

then it will look, if the repo's main branch is 'main' or 'master'
then simply, it download the zip and extracts it..
