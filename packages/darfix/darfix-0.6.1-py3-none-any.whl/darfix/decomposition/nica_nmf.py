	"""
    Non-negative matrix factorization with non-negative ICA (NICA)
    initialization.

    Under the linear generative model x = A * s, where x is a p-dimensional
    observable random vector, s is the latent non-negative random vector of
    length num_components and A is a fixed (but unknown) non-negative matrix,
    this function tries to determine both s and A. The data matrix X is
    assumed to hold n samples of x, stacked in rows (shape(X) = (n, p)) or
    columns (shape(X) = (p, n)), which can be specified by the rowvar parameter.
    In practice, if shape(X) = (p, n) (resp. shape(X) = (n, p)) this function
    solves X = A * S (resp. X = S.T * A.T) both for S and A, where A is the
    so-called mixing matrix, with shape (p, num_components), and S is a
    (num_components, n) matrix which contains n samples of the latent source
    vector, stacked in columns.

    The non-uniqueness (non-convexity) property of NMF implies that the
    solution depends on the initial factor matrices.
    This function implements the idea presented in:
    `Efficient initialization for nonnegative matrix factorization based on
    nonnegative independent component analysisÂ´
    (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7602947)
    which suggests that a good initialization is based on the factorization
    given by non-negative ICA.
