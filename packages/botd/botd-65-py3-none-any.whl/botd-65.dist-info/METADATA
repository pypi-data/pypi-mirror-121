DESCRIPTION
===========

**BOTD** is an attempt to achieve OS level integration of bot technology
directly into the operating system. A solid, non hackable bot, that runs
under systemd and rc.d as a 24/7 background service that starts the
bot after reboot, stores it's data as JSON files on disk, every object is
timestamped, readonly of which the latest is served to the user layer. This
bot is intended to be programmable in a static, only code, no popen, no
imports and no reading modules from a directory, way that makes it suitable
for embedding.
