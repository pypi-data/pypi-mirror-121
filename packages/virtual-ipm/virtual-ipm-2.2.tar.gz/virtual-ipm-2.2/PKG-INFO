        Virtual-IPM
        ===========
        
        Virtual-IPM is a software which combines efforts towards simulations of Ionization Profile Monitors
        and was developed for the IPMSim collaboration. It has been designed with focus on flexibility and
        extensibility in order to cover a broad range of
        `use cases <https://ipmsim.gitlab.io/Virtual-IPM/use-cases.html>`_.
        It combines aspects of a framework
        - which enables `developers <https://ipmsim.gitlab.io/Virtual-IPM/developers/introduction.html>`_
        to realize their own ideas - as well as of a stand-alone application which allows
        `users <https://ipmsim.gitlab.io/Virtual-IPM/usage.html>`_ to effortlessly specify and run their own cases.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Virtual-IPM can be installed via ``pip`` with or without GUI components. ``pip install Virtual-IPM[GUI]`` installs
        the application together with the graphical user interface while ``pip install Virtual-IPM`` just installs the command
        line version. For more information see `the documentation <https://ipmsim.gitlab.io/Virtual-IPM/installation.html>`_.
