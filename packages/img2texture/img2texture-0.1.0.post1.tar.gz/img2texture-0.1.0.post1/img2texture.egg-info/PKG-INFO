# [img2texture](https://github.com/rtmigo/img2texture_py#readme)

Command line utility for converting images to seamless tiles.

The resulting tiles can be used as textures in games, compositing and 3D modeling applications, etc.

### Original image x4

![Source tiled](docs/1_orion_src_2x2.jpg)

Orion galaxy by NASA/ESA, in four copies side by side. 

We cannot use the original image as an endless space background: the seams are visible.

### Converted image x4

![Converted tiled](docs/2_orion_seamless_2x2.jpg)

The result of `img2texture`, in four copies side by side. 

The image is slightly reduced in size and the edges are modified with 
alpha-blending.

The converted image can be tiled and panned in any 
direction. It will feel endless and seamless.

# Install

```
$ pip3 install img2texture
```

# Run

Create new `seamless.jpg` from `source.jpg`.
```
$ img2texture /path/to/source.jpg /path/to/seamless.jpg 
```

## --overlap

The `--overlap` option determines how much of the image will be used to hide the seams.

For example, the following command uses 25% of the width and 25% of the height 
of the original image:

```
$ img2texture source.jpg seamless.jpg --overlap 0.25 
```

Increasing the value makes the seam less visible. However, the image becomes smaller.

### --overlap 0.05

The 5% seam.

![--overlap 0.05](docs/3_orion_05_2x2.jpg)



### --overlap 0.4

The 40% seam.

![--overlap 40](docs/3_orion_40_2x2.jpg)

</details>

## --tile

The `--tile` option will create a 2x2 tiled version in addition to the converted image.

The following command will create `seamless.jpg` and `seamless_2x2.jpg`. 

```
$ img2texture source.jpg seamless.jpg --tile 
```

All the samples on this page were created with `--tile`.
