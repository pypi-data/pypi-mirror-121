# GeneFlow

Version: 3.0.0-alpha.1

GeneFlow (GF) is a light-weight, extendable workflow engine for scientific computing.

## Requirements

At a minimum, GeneFlow requires a Linux environment with Python 3. The Python pip installer for GeneFlow handles all python dependencies.

## Quick Start

General installation instructions can be found in the [Additional Documentation](#additional-documentation).

### Install GeneFlow in a Python Virtual Environment

If you need to install GeneFlow, it is recommended to use a Python3 virtual environment. However, if you have root access and want to install GeneFlow system-wide, you may skip the virtual environment step.

1.  Create and activate a Python3 virtual environment:

    ```
    python3 -m venv gfpy
    source gfpy/bin/activate
    ```

2.  Clone the GeneFlow source repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jhphan/geneflow
    ```

3.  Install GeneFlow:

    ```
    pip3 install ./geneflow
    ```

4.  Test the installation by running the GeneFlow CLI:

    ```
    geneflow --help
    ```
