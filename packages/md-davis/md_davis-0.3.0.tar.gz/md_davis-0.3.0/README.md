Introduction
------------
MD DaVis is a tool for comparative analysis of molecular dynamics simulations of proteins.

Documentation: [https://md-davis.readthedocs.io](https://md-davis.readthedocs.io)

Features
--------
1. Free energy landscape
2. Residue properties plot
3. Surface electrostatics
4. Electric field dynamics
5. H-bond/Contact matrix

System Requirements
-------------------

* A 64-bit operating system
* A Python 3 installation with version â‰¥ 3.7

Installation
------------
The easiest installation method is with
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
It is highly recommended to install MD DaVis in a virtual environment.
The [environment.yml](https://github.com/djmaity/md-davis/blob/master/environment.yml)
is provided to ease the process.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml -n md_davis_env
```
This automatically creates a conda environment called `md_davis_env` with all required dependencies.
Activate the environment and install MD DaVis in it using:
```
conda activate md_davis_env
pip install md-davis
```

For detailed installation instructions, see:
[https://md-davis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html](https://md-davis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

### Dependencies

The following dependencies will have to be obtained separately.
* [Delphi](http://compbio.clemson.edu/delphi)
* [MSMS](http://mgltools.scripps.edu/downloads#msms)
* [GROMACS](https://www.gromacs.org)

Usage
-----

If MD DaVis is installed in a virtual environment, it should be activated before using MD DaVis.
For example, to activate the virtual environment created with conda, use:
```
conda activate md_davis_env
```

The MD DaVis CLI can be called with:
```
