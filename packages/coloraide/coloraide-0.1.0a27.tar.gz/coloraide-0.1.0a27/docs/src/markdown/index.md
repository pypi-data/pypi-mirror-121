!!! warning "Currently in Alpha"
    While ColorAide is very usable, it is currently in an alpha stage. While that doesn't necessarily mean buggy, it
    does mean the API could be unstable.

## Overview

ColorAide is a color library for Python with the intent to provide an easy to use interface to work with colors. While
ColorAide is not just for CSS colors, there is a focus on supporting modern CSS color syntax as it is a format that is
very commonly used. In addition to being able to parse almost all colors as specified in the CSS specification,
ColorAide also supports a number of colors and formats for colors that are not in the CSS spec.

ColorAide is built on the idea of having a general color object in which you can easily manipulate a color, convert
between colors in different spaces, and perform color related functions: interpolation, color distancing, color
contrast, etc.

In the process of developing ColorAide, we also stumbled upon the JavaScript library [Color.js][colorjs] which is
created/maintained by the co-authors of some of the recent CSS color specifications. This project became heavily
influenced by Color.js as it adopted a model we were already interested in. While our aim was not to port that library
and be a 1:1 copy of it, it provided much clarity on the CSS specification and, in the end, left a clear impression on
our API.

With ColorAide, you can create colors:

```playground
from coloraide import Color
c = Color('red')
c.to_string()
```

Convert colors:

```playground
from coloraide import Color
Color('red').convert('hsl').to_string()
```

Modify colors:

```playground
from coloraide import Color
Color('red').set("lch.chroma", 30).to_string()
```

Mix colors:

```playground
from coloraide import Color
Color("blue").mix("yellow", space="lch").to_string()
```

And much more!

## Installation

ColorAide can be installed via Python's `pip`:

```console
$ pip install coloraide
```
