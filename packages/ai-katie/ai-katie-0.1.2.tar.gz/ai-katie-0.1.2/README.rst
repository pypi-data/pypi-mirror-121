Setup
=====
To setup to library you need at least Python 3.8 and pip installed.

Also as the package uses PyTorch I strongly suggest to install the PyTorch
in the distribution of your choice from: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ before installing the library.

When all dependencies are installed you can install the library by:

    $ pip install ai-katie
