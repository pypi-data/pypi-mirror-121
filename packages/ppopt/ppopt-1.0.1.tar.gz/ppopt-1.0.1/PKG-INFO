Description: **P**ython **P**arametric **OP**timization **T**oolbox (**PPOPT**) is a software platform for solving and manipulating multiparametric programs in Python. This package is still in development but the following features are complete and are in full working order.
        
        #### Completed Features
        * Solver interface for mpLPs and mpQP with the following algorithms
          1. Serial and Parallel Combinatorial Algorithm
          2. Serial and Parallel Geometrical Algorithm
          3.  Serial and Parallel Graph based algorithm
        * Multiparametric solution export to C++, Javacript, Matlab, and Python
        * Plotting utilities
        * Presolver and Conditioning for Multiparametric Programs
        
        ## Key Applications
        
        * Explicit Model Predictive Control
        * Multilevel Optimization 
        * Integrated Design, Control, and Scheduling
        * Robust Optimization
        
        For more information about Multiparametric programming and it's applications, [this paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fceng.2020.620168/full) is a good jumping point.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Currently PPOPT requires Python 3.7 or higher and can be installed with the following commands.
        
        ```bash
        pip install -e git+https://github.com/mmihaltz/pysettrie.git#egg=pysettrie
        pip install ppopt
        ```
