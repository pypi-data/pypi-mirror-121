        Description
        ===========
        
        This package provides a pure Python client-server `Universal Chess Interface`_ to a chess engine intended for analysing positions rather than playing games.
        
        
        Installation Instructions
        =========================
        
        Usually this package will be installed by installing `ChessTab`_.
        
        Install the package by typing
        
           python setup.py install
        
        at the command prompt with setup.py in the current directory.
        
        You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:
        
           <path to python>/python<version> setup.py install
        
           For example
        
              C:\\Python36\\python setup.py install
        
                 on Microsoft Windows or
        
              python3.6 setup.py install
        
                 on Unix-like systems.
        
        Use `Python`_ 3.6 or later.
        
        
        Run
        ===
        
        The command to run the server is:
        
           python -m uci_net.tcp_driver [port] [allowed callers] path [options]
        
        A path to a UCI chess engine must be given.
        
        See chess engine documentation for options.
        
        By default anyone is allowed to use the server, subject to firewall restrictions.  A comma
        separated list of hostnames prevents hosts not in the list from using the server.
        
        Conections to the server are made on port 'port'.  The default is 11111.
        
        Assuming a hostname 'stockfishbox' with IP address 192.168.0.1 and the default port, suitable engine definition records in `ChessTab`_ are:
        
           '//stockfishbox:11111?name=Stockfish 12' or
           '//192.168.0.1:11111?name=Stockfish 12'.
        
        The record says 'name=Stockfish 12' because 'Stockfish 12' is the 'id name' value returned by Stockfish 12 in response to the 'uci' command.
        
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        Project name and package name changed from 'uci' to 'uci-net' prior to upload to PyPI.
