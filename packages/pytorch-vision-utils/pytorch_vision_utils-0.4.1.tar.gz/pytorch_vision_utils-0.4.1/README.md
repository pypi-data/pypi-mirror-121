# PyTorch Vision Training and Data Visualization Package
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pytorch-vision-utils.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pytorch-vision-utils) [![Test Build Methods](https://github.com/nclgbd/PyTorch-Utilities/actions/workflows/run-all-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nclgbd/PyTorch-Utilities/actions/workflows/run-all-tests.yml) [![Publish Package](https://github.com/nclgbd/PyTorch-Utilities/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nclgbd/PyTorch-Utilities/actions/workflows/python-publish.yml)

This package is an abstraction of some common things functions I use when using PyTorch. Rather than constantly having to copy over a file for each project, just creating a package that can be installed with `pip` could be beneficial.

Hopefully in the future I can have colleagues also find use with this, or extend off of it.

If you'd like to see what I plan on implementing and where things are currently, check [here](https://github.com/nclgbd/PyTorch-Utilities/projects/1).
