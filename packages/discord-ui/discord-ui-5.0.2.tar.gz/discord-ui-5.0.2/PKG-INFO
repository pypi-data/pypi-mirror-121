## Introduction


This is a [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) ui extension made by [404kuso](https://github.com/404kuso) and [RedstoneZockt](https://github.com/RedstoneZockt)
for using discord's newest ui features like buttons, slash commands and context commands (we got dpy2 supported if you want to keep using our libary)

[Documentation](https://discord-ui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Installation


### Windows
```cmd
py -m pip install discord-ui
```

### Linux
```bash
python3 -m pip install discord-ui
```

## Issues

If you find any issues, please report them 

https://github.com/discord-py-ui/discord-ui/issues

## Note

If you want to use slash commands, in the oauth2 invite link generation, 
you have to check both `bot` and `application.commands` fields

![](./docs/source/images/slash/invite_scope.png)

## Example

Example for creating a simple slash command
```py
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
from discord_ui import UI, SlashOption

client = commands.Bot(" ")
ui = UI(client)

@ui.slash.command("hello_world", options=[SlashOption(bool, "cool", "whether this libary is cool", required=False)], guild_ids=[785567635802816595])
async def command(ctx, cool=True):
    """This is a simple slash command"""
    # you can use docstrings for the slash command description too
    await ctx.respond("You said this libary is " + str(cool))

client.run("your_token")
```

Example for creating a user-context command
```py
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
from discurd_ui import UI

client = commands.Bot(" ")
ui = UI(client)

@ui.slash.user_command("avatar", guild_ids=[785567635802816595])
async def avatar(ctx, user: discord.Member):
    """Sends the avatar of a user"""
    await ctx.respond(embed=discord.Embed(description=user.display_name).set_image(url=user.avatar_url))

client.run("your_token")
```

Example for autocompletion of choices

```py
import discord
from discord_ui import UI, SlashOption, ChoiceGeneratorContext

async def generator(ctx: ChoiceGeneratorContext):
    available_choices = ["hmm", "this", "is", "a", "an", "test", "testing"]
    return [(x, x) for x in available_choices if x.startswith(ctx.value_query)]

@ui.slash.command("search_word", options=[SlashOption(str, "query", choice_generator=generator)])
async def search_word(ctx, query):
    await ctx.send("got " + query + " for query")

client.run("your_token")
```

Example for sending a button and receiving it

```py
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
from discord_ui import UI, LinkButton, Button

from asyncio import TimeoutError

client = commands.Bot(" ")
ui = UI(client)

@client.listen("on_message")
async def on_message(message: discord.Message):
    if message.content == "!btn":
        msg = await message.channel.send("you", components=[
            [Button("custom_id", "press me", color="green"), LinkButton("https://discord.com", emoji="üòÅ")],
            Button("my_custom_id")
        ])
        try:
            btn = await msg.wait_for("button", client, by=message.author, timeout=20)
            await btn.respond("you pressed `" + btn.content + "`")
        except TimeoutError:
            await msg.delete()

client.run("your_token_here")
```

Example for sending Selectmenus and receiving them

```py
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
from discord_ui import UI, SelectMenu, SelectOption

from asyncio import TimeoutError

client = commands.Bot(" ")
ui = UI(client)

@client.listen("on_message")
async def on_message(message: discord.Message):
    if message.content == "!sel":
        msg = await message.channel.send("you", components=[SelectMenu("custom_id", options=[
            SelectOption("my_value", label="test", description="this is a test"),
            SelectOption("my_other_value", emoji="ü§ó", description="this is a test too")
        ], max_values=2)])
        try:
            sel = await msg.wait_for("select", client, by=message.author, timeout=20)
            await sel.respond("you selected `" + str([x.content for x in sel.selected_options]) + "`")
        except TimeoutError:
            await msg.delete()

client.run("your_token_here")
```

Example for cogs
```py
from discord.ext import commands
from discord_ui import UI
from discord_ui.cogs import slash_cog, subslash_cog, listening_component_cog

bot = commands.Bot(" ")
ui = UI(bot)

class Example(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot
    
    @slash_cog(name="example", guild_ids=[785567635802816595])
    async def example(self, ctx):
        await ctx.respond("gotchu")

    @subslash_cog(base_names="example", name="command"):
    async def example_command(self, ctx):
        await ctx.respond("okayy")
    
bot.add_cog(Example(bot))
bot.run("your token")
```
