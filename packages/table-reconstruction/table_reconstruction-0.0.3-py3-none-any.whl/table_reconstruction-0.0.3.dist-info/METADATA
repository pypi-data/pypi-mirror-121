# Table Reconstruction

`table-reconstruction` is a tool used to detect table spaces and reconstruct the information in them using DL models.

To provide the above feature, Table reconstruction works based on several components as follows:

- A table detection model is developed based on Yolov5
- A line segmentation model is built based on Unet
- Additional modules are used in the information extraction process, especially a directed graph is used to extract information related to the merged cells.

## Installation

Table Reconstruction is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/table-reconstruction/) and can be installed from there:

```bash
pip install table-reconstruction
```

You can also install this package manually with the following command:

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Basic usage

you can easily use this library by using the following statements

```python
import torch
from table_reconstruction import TableExtraction

device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
extraction = TableExtraction(device=device)


image = ... # Accept Numpy ndarray and PIL image
tables = extraction.extract(image)
```

We also provide a simple Jupyter notebook which can be used to illustrate the results obtained after processing, please check it out [here](https://github.com/sun-asterisk-research/table_reconstruction/blob/master/example/example.ipynb)

## Documentation

Documentation will be available soon.
