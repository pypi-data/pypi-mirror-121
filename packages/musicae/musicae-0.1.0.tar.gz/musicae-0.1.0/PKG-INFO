Description: # MusicAE: Encoding songs with Autoencoders to reveal structure #
        
        Hello, and welcome on this repository!
        
        This project aims at autoenconding all bars in a song, and studies the latent representations of every bar to infer its structure.
        In that sense, every latent space is specialized for a song, and do not aim at generalizing between different songs.
        
        This repository contains code for the Autoencoders, developed in PyTorch, and segmentation methods based on autosimilarity segmentation, as presented in [1].
        
        You can download it using pip, by typing:
        
            pip install musicae
        
        Or download the source files.
        
        This is a first release, and may contain bug. Comments are welcomed!
        
        ## Software version ##
        
        This code was developed with Python 3.8.5, and some external libraries detailed in dependencies.txt. They should be installed automatically if this project is downloaded using pip.
        
        ## Example Notebook ##
        
        An example notebook is available in the folder "Notebooks", and presents the song 'Come Together' with different features.
        
        ## Credits ##
        
        Code was created by Axel Marmoret (<axel.marmoret@irisa.fr>), and strongly supported by Jeremy E. Cohen (<jeremy.cohen@irisa.fr>).
        
        The technique in itself was also developed by FrÃ©dÃ©ric Bimbot (<bimbot@irisa.fr>).
