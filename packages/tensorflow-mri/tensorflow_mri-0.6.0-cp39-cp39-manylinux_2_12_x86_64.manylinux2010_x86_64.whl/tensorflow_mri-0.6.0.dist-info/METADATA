.. start-intro

TensorFlow MRI is a collection of TensorFlow add-ons for computational MRI.

It contains functionality including:

* Estimation of coil sensitivity maps: Walsh's method, Inati's fast method and
  ESPIRiT.
* Coil compression using singular value decomposition (SVD).
* Image reconstruction operations: basic (FFT, NUFFT), parallel imaging
  (SENSE, GRAPPA, CG-SENSE) and partial Fourier (zero-filling, homodyne
  detection, projection onto convex sets). 
* Calculation of radial and spiral trajectories and sampling densities.
* Keras metrics for image quality assessment, classification and segmentation.
* Helper operations for array manipulation, image processing and linear algebra.

All operations are performed using a TensorFlow/Keras backend. This has several
key advantages:

* Seamless integration in machine learning applications.
* Runs on heterogeneous systems, with most operations supporting CPU and
  GPU-accelerated paths.
* Code is easy to understand, with most of this package written in Python.

Installation
------------

.. start-install

You can install TensorFlow MRI with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install tensorflow-mri

Note that only Linux is currently supported.

FAQ
---

.. start-faq

**When trying to install TensorFlow MRI, I get an error about OpenEXR which
includes:
`OpenEXR.cpp:36:10: fatal error: ImathBox.h: No such file or directory`. What do
I do?**

OpenEXR is needed by TensorFlow Graphics, which is a dependency of TensorFlow
MRI. This issue can be fixed by installing the OpenEXR library. On
Debian/Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: console

    $ apt install libopenexr-dev
