# statistical Distributions

A statistical tool for solving basic statistic distributions

Gaussian Distribution
Binoial Distribution

**Basic Usage**

```

>>> from statistical_distributions import Gaussian, Binomial

initiating new object of Gaussian Class
>>> Gaussian(4,10)
mean 4, standard deviation 10

initiating new object of Binomial Class
>>> Binomial(.4, 12)
mean 4.800000000000001, standard deviation 1.6970562748477143, p 0.4, n 12

```
