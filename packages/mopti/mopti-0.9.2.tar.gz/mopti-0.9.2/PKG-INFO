Description: # Opti
        
        Opti is a Python package for specifying problems in a number of closely related fields, including experimental design, multiobjective optimization and decision making and Bayesion optimization.
        
        #### Why opti?
        Opti 
        * supports mixed continuous, discrete and categorical parameter spaces for system inputs and outputs,
        * separates objectives (minimize, maximize, close-to-target) from the outputs on which they operate,
        * supports different specific and generic constraints as well as black-box output constraints,
        * provides sampling methods for constrained mixed variable spaces,
        * json-serializes problems for use in RESTful APIs and json/bson DBs, and
        * provides a range of benchmark problems for (multi-objective) optimization and Bayesian optimization.
