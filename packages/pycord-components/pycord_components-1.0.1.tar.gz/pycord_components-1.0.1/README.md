## Welcome!

Discord components are cool, but pycord's document lacks ease of use in components. It
is hard to wait, so we made a third-party library for using components such as
buttons or selects!

This project is open source ‚≠ê.

## Features

- You can use message components and handle component interactions easily!
- Third-party of pycord.
- It is simply changed version of discord-components which doesn't require discord.py. Why? Because it is deprecated.

## Install

```
pip install --upgrade pycord-components
```
