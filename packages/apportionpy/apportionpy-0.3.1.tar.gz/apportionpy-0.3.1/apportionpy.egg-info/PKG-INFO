A package that allows users to apportion seats to states based on population figures.

This apportionment package calculates results for the following methods:
 - Hamilton's method
 - Jefferson's method
 - Adam's method
 - Webster's method
 - Huntington Hill's method
 - Method of equal proportions

Hamilton's method calculations:
 - fair shares
 - initial fair shares
 - initial quotas
 - final quotas
 - initial divisor
 - modified divisor

Jefferson's method calculations:
 - fair shares
 - initial fair shares
 - initial quotas
 - final quotas
 - initial divisor
 - modified divisor
 - divisor history

Adam's method calculations:
 - fair shares
 - initial fair shares
 - initial quotas
 - final quotas
 - initial divisor
 - modified divisor
 - divisor history

Webster's method calculations:
 - fair shares
 - initial fair shares
 - initial quotas
 - final quotas
 - initial divisor
 - modified divisor
 - divisor history

Huntington Hill's method calculations:
 - fair shares
 - initial fair shares
 - initial quotas
 - final quotas
 - initial geometric means
 - final geometric means
 - initial divisor
 - modified divisor

Method of equal proportions calculations:
 - fair shares

Experimental features:
 - estimate the lowest possible divisor possible
 - estimate the highest possible divisor possible
