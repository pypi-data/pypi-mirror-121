Deciding no how to handle "global" config is a bit more complicated
for multiprocessing than it is for a single process (with or without threads).

Since each process loads Python, to get the same config values for all processes
they all need to either read the same config file, or create copies of the
"original" for themselves. Using something like a multiprocessing.Manager()
seems excessive, as it is unlikely that the values will change during a run.
Leaving that open for the future makes some sense.

That means that each process will need to be either passed the name of the
config file to be read, or the results of that (and any changes prior to
creation of the child processes). Passing the config instance seems to be
no more complex than passing the file reference.

The config data should be easy to access in each of the modules.
Several options for "singleton" behavior:

1) Use a bare module

Advantages:

    Simple access

        import pyDE1.config as config
        do_something_with(config.section.VALUE)

    Only one instance "guaranteed"

Disadvantages:

    No top-level properties

        Though there may be a way to define them, the @property decorator
        will create a property object, but it doesn't seem useful.

        This is one of the main reasons that the Singleton object is used
        for the primary components of pyDE1 (the other is no dangling instances)


2) Module that defines an instance, refer to the instance

Advantages:

    Simple access

        from pyDE1.config import config
        do_something_with(config.section.VALUE)

Disadvantages:

    It is possible that second instance, disconnected from the "real" one,
    could be generated with config = Config()

3) Subclass Singleton

Advantages:

    Only one instance "guaranteed"

Disadvantages:

    More complex access

        from pyDE1.config import Config
        pointer_to_config = Config()    # At the module or function level
        do_something_with(config.section.VALUE)
