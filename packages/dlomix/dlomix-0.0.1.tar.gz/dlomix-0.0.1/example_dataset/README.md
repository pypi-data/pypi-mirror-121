### Example Retention Time Dataset

Toy dataset extracted from the `iRT_ProteomeTools_ReferenceSet.csv` dataset.

Assumptions:
- dataset should be sufficiently large to show case a model learning to predict indexed retention time.
- dataset will be constructed by picking sequences from all the available lengths and distributing them on the three splits. In other words, the splitting was stratified on the length of the sequence.
- splitting was done with `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` with a `random_state = 21`
- it should not be very large in order to facilitate training on small GPUs, preferably also on CPU.
- all examples should be unmodified
- remove duplicated sequences (one iRT value for each sequence)


Output Format:
- csv file that can be read as a pandas dataframe
- dataframe should have two columns; `sequence` and `irt`
- the `sequence` column is a string and `irt` is a floating point number
- sequences have a variable length, they are not padded

Total number of data examples is `40,000`. They are split in the following files:
- `proteomTools_train.csv`: Training data with `27,200` ~ 68%
- `proteomTools_val.csv`: Validation data with `6,800` ~ 17%
- `proteomTools_test.csv`: Test data with `6,000` ~ 15%
- `proteomTools_train_val.csv`: Training and Validation data with `34,000` ~ 85%. This can be used to do a custom train/val split, otherwise the predefined split above can be used.
