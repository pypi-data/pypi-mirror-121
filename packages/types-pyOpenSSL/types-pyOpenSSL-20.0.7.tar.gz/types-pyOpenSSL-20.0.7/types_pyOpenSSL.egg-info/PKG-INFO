## Typing stubs for pyOpenSSL

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `pyOpenSSL` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `pyOpenSSL`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/pyOpenSSL. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.
