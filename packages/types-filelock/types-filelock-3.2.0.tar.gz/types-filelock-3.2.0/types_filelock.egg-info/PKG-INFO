## Typing stubs for filelock

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `filelock` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `filelock`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/filelock. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `32bc2161a107db20c2ebc85aad31c29730db3e38`.
