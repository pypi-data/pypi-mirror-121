"""
This module interfaces with the external services the program uses to hydrate with financial data. In the case of price and interest history, the functions in this module defer to the cache before making expensive HTTP requests. Statistical data retrieved from FRED and dividment payment histories are not persisted in the cache since most of the data is reported on an irregular basis and it is impossible to tell based on the date alone whether or not the cache is out of date.

    Description
    -----------
        StatManager is an interface between the application and the external services that hydrate it with financial statistics data. This class gets instantiated on the level of the `scrilla.services` module with the value defined in `scrilla.settings.STAT_MANAGER`. This value is in turn defined by the value of the `STAT_MANAGER` environment variable. This value determines how the url is constructed, which API credentials get appended to the external query and the keys used to parse the response JSON container the statistical data.

It should never need to know `StatManger` is a Quandl interface. Just in case the library ever needs to populate its data from another source. \n \n

        Parameters
        ----------
        1. ticker : str \n
            Required. Ticker symbol of the asset whose prices are being retrieved. \n \n
        2. asset_type : str \n
            Required: Asset type of the asset whose prices are being retrieved. Options are statically
            accessible in the `scrillla.static` module dictionary `scrilla.static.keys['ASSETS']`. \n \n

        ------
        1. errors.ConfigurationError \n

        Parameters
        ----------
        1. ticker : str \n
            Required. Ticker symbol of the asset whose prices are being retrieved. \n \n
        2. asset_type : str \n
            Required: Asset type of the asset whose prices are being retrieved. Options are statically

        2. errors.APIResponseError \n
            If the service from which data is being retrieved is down, the request has been rate limited or some otherwise anomalous event has taken place, this error will be thrown. \n \n

    3. slice_prices
        Parameters
        ----------
        1. start_date : datetime.date \n 
        2. end_date : datetime.date \n
        3. asset_type : str \n

        ------
        1. KeyError \n
            If the inputted or validated dates do not exist in the price history, a KeyError will be thrown. This could be due to the equity not having enough price history, i.e. it started trading a month ago and doesn't have 100 days worth of prices yet, or some other anomalous event in an equity's history. 
        2. errors.ConfigurationError \n
            If one of the settings is improperly configured or one of the environment variables was unable to be parsed from the environment, this error will be thrown. \n \n

        Parameters
        ----------
        1. prices : { str : str } \n
            2D list containing the AlphaVantage response with the first layer peeled off, i.e.
            no metadata, just the date and prices. \n \n
        2. date: str \n
            String of the date to be parsed. Note: this is not a datetime.date object. String
            must be formatted YYYY-MM-DD \n \n
        3. asset_type : str \n
            String that specifies what type of asset price is being parsed. Options are statically
            accessible in the `scrillla.static` module dictionary `scrilla.static.keys['ASSETS']` \n \n

        Returns
        ------
            String containing the price on the specified date.
        
        Raises
        ------
        1. KeyError \n
            If the inputted or validated dates do not exist in the price history, a KeyError will be thrown. This could be due to the equity not having enough price history, i.e. it started trading a month ago and doesn't have 100 days worth of prices yet, or some other anomalous event in an equity's history. 
        2. errors.InputValidationError \n
            If prices was unable to be grouped into a (crypto, equity)-asset class or the opening/closing price did not exist for whatever reason, this error will be thrown.

    """
    Wrapper around external service request for price data. Relies on an instance of `PriceManager` configured by `settings.PRICE_MANAGER` value, which in turn is configured by the `PRICE_MANAGER` environment variable, to hydrate with data. 
    
    Before deferring to the `PriceManager` and letting it call the external service, however, this function checks if response is in local cache. If the response is not in the cache, it will pass the request off to `PriceManager` and then save the response in the cache so subsequent calls to the function can bypass the service request. Used to prevent excessive external HTTP requests and improve the performance of the application. Other parts of the program should interface with the external price data services through this function to utilize the cache functionality.

    Parameters
    ----------
    1. **ticker** :  ``str``
        Ticker symbol corresponding to the price history to be retrieved.
    2. **start_date** : ``datetime.date`` 
        *Optional*. Start date of price history. Defaults to None. If `start_date is None`, the calculation is made as if the `start_date` were set to 100 trading days ago. If `scrilla.files.get_asset_type(ticker)==scrill.static.keys['ASSETS']['CRYPTO']`, this includes weekends and holidays. If `scrilla.files.get_asset_type(ticker)==scrilla.static.keys['ASSETS']['EQUITY']`, this excludes weekends and holidays.
    3. **end_date** : ``datetime.date``
        Optional End date of price history. Defaults to None. If `end_date is None`, the calculation is made as if the `end_date` were set to today. If `scrilla.files.get_asset_type(ticker)==scrill.static.keys['ASSETS']['CRYPTO']`, this means today regardless. If `scrilla.files.get_asset_type(ticker)==scrilla.static.keys['ASSETS']['EQUITY']`, this excludes weekends and holidays so that `end_date` is set to the previous business date. 
    4. **asset_type** : ``string``
        *Optional*. Asset type of the ticker whose history is to be retrieved. Used to prevent excessive calls to IO and list searching. `asset_type` is determined by comparing the ticker symbol `ticker` to a large static list of ticker symbols maintained in installation directory's /data/static/ subdirectory, which can slow the program down if the file is constantly accessed and lots of comparison are made against it. Once an `asset_type` is calculated, it is best to preserve it in the process environment somehow, so this function allows the value to be passed in. If no value is detected, it will make a call to the aforementioned directory and parse the file to determine to the `asset_type`. Asset types are statically accessible through the `scrilla.static.keys['ASSETS']` dictionary.

    Returns
    ------
    ``dict``: `{ 'date' (str) : { 'open': value (str), 'close': value (str) }, 'date' (str): { 'open' : value (str), 'close' : value(str) }, ... }`
        Dictionary with date strings formatted `YYYY-MM-DD` as keys and a nested dictionary containing the 'open' and 'close' price as values. Ordered from latest to earliest.
    
    .. notes::
        * The default analysis period, if no `start_date` and `end_date` are specified, is determined by the *DEFAULT_ANALYSIS_PERIOD** variable in the `settings,py` file. The default value of this variable is 100.
